# Neural Networks: As concise as they get

Machine Learning, being the fascinating field it is, might at times seem un-intuitive and at times even convoluted in its implementation. The aim of this repository is to provide concise neural network implementations and tutorials along with them, in order to facilitate their introduction.

This repository is currently under construction, and the available code in the final_code folder contains the following implementations:

  - net_from_scratch.py : This is a three layer iterative implementation of a binary classifier neural network. Readme and tutorial in progress.
  - neural_net_optimized.py : This is a three layer implementation of a binary classifier neural network utilizing external optimizers other than simple iterative backpropagation. Readme and tutorial in progress.

# Dependencies

The implementations depend on autograd (https://github.com/HIPS/autograd), a numpy code differentiator, for the objective function derivatives and optimizers. 
# Future Work

Current work is being done into developing concise implementations of Bayesian Neural Networks with reguralization, and Readme and tutorials with explanations of implementations are in the process of being written.
